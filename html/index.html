          <b>Orange</b> is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of
          visible light. Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a
          dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres. In painting
          and traditional colour theory, it is a secondary colour of pigments,
          produced by mixing yellow and red. In the RGB color model, it is a
          tertiary colour. It is named after the fruit of the same name.

          The orange colour of many fruits and vegetables, such as carrots,
          pumpkins, sweet potatoes, and oranges, comes from carotenes, a type of
          photosynthetic pigment. These pigments convert the light energy that the
          plants absorb from the Sun into chemical energy for the plants' growth.
          Similarly, the hues of autumn leaves are from the same pigment after
          chlorophyll is removed.

          In Europe and America, surveys show that orange is the colour most
          associated with amusement, the unconventional, extroversion, warmth,
          fire, energy, activity, danger, taste and aroma, the autumn and
          Allhallowtide seasons, as well as having long been the national colour
          of the Netherlands and the House of Orange. It also serves as the
          political colour of the Christian democracy political ideology and most
          Christian democratic political parties.<sup
